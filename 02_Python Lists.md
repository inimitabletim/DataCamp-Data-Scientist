# Python Lists

List can contain any type

# Subsetting Lists

zero-based indexing

[ start : end ] inclusive/exclusive

# Manipulating Lists

## change: assign new value

list[0] = new_object

If you want to prevent changes in new_list from also taking effect list
you'll have to do a more explicit copy of the list.
You can do this with list() or by using list[:].

# add: use +

[list] + [a,b] will add a and b in the end of list

# del(list[value])
